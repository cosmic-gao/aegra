"""Thread-scoped session that turns one run's broker events into v2 events.

A session subscribes to a run's broker (the same broker the legacy SSE
path uses), translates each raw event into protocol channel events,
assigns a session-local monotonic ``seq``, applies the client's channel
filter, and yields wire envelopes. Lifecycle events are derived from the
run's terminal ``end`` / ``error`` broker signals.

Resume: a client passes the last ``seq`` it saw as ``since``; the session
replays the broker's buffer and skips anything at or below that cursor
before going live.
